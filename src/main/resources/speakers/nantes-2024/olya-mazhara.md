Scala has been my coding playground for about 5 wonderful years. While I've never taken the stage at conferences, I'm an avid attendee, soaking up the vibrant energy of the Scala community. My journey includes sharing the love for Scala by teaching courses at the university and organising cozy Scala meet-ups with friends. I even celebrated a birthday at one of our Scala gatherings, making it a memorable affair.

Working with phenomenal individuals has shaped my perspective, making the Scala world, for me, a realm of camaraderie and shared passion. I believe friendship is the key factor in community creation, and I'm excited to delve into my experiences and insights on building strong, connected Scala communities amidst challenges.
