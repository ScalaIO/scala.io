My name is Olivier Mélois. I have been using Scala as my main language for since 2013. I maintain weaver-test and smithy4s, and have contribute to many libraries and tools, from ammonite to cats-effect.

After leaving in Manchester (UK) for a while, I moved back to the countryside in the south of France, and now work remotely full-time in the countryside. I try to grow vegetables.
