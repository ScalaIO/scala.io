Monica is a junior Scala developer at JP Morgan, working in a team who aims to improve understanding of the banksâ€™ data and data models.

She began her programming journey using C#, then onto a mixture C++, JavaScript and TypeScript throughout her undergraduate Physics degree. She now writes Scala full time in her current position. Monica is also passionate about encouraging those who do not have a Computer Science background into software development roles, as she has been able to apply her transferable problem-solving skills from a scientific discipline to programming and is really enjoying it!
