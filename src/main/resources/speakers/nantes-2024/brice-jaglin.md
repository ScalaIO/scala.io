I am the main maintainer of Scalafix since 2020, after I discovered the potential of using custom rules in a modular monolith at work and started contributing to the project to make that easier. Currently a Staff Engineer at Swile, I no longer use Scala on a day-to-day basis but I continue to maintain Scalafix on my free time as I have yet to find such a powerful tool in another ecosystem
