# When all the nails are trees, the hammer you need probably looks like a chainsaw

For the last months, most of the problems I had to solve at work have been about trees.

Initially, I tried to solve the problems the way other similar problems are solved in the codebase and it was painful.

Then I looked for better tools and discovered [Rose Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_tree) : a very straightforward tree that comes with the operators you already know.

In this talk, I will show you with some code and drawings what I learnt in
the process and how it helped me solved my problems with less pain.
