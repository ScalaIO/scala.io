# My first year in Scala

Navigating the world of Scala and functional programming as a beginner can feel daunting and intimidating. Over a year ago, I was thrown into learning Scala headfirst.

Now, having come out on the other side, I want to share the lessons I learned with other beginners, as well as what I wish the senior developers I worked with knew. I started my Scala journey at a corporate bank after graduating with a degree in Physics. So, not only did I have to learn Scala from scratch, but I also had to apply these concepts to a domain I had no prior knowledge of. Initially, I experienced a lot of confusion and frustration, trying to navigate a new language, along with a new job and learning to work in a large team. Thankfully, my experienced Scala colleagues were always there to help me and answer the many, many questions I had.

In this talk, I will cover three key concepts that emerged from reflecting on this past year of learning:

1. Making Mistakes
2. Helping Others to Help You
3. Finding Community

By the end of this talk, I hope that newcomers will feel less alone and more optimistic about diving into the exciting world of Scala, and that experienced developers will gain a better understanding of how to best support their juniors in their learning journey.
