# Scala Unites: Fostering Community During War Times

In the face of unprecedented challenges during the post-COVID and wartime period in Ukraine, the Scala community not only survived but remain strong and connected. Join me as I share my journey as a Scala community member and temporary displaced person, navigating through canceled events, evacuations, and uncertain times.

Discover how Ukrainian Scala developers managed to create a resilient Scala community in the midst of chaos, including the formation of the Scala Ukraine Scala group, organizing a supportive Scala meetup for the Ukrainian army, and conducting webinars even with a friend on the frontline.

Learn about our increased presence at conferences, participation in programs like Google Summer of Code, and the establishment of a Scala book club with 41 meetings and counting. Iâ€™ll delve into the key factors that contributed to building these small yet stable communities, serving as a solid foundation for the overall growth of the Scala community.
