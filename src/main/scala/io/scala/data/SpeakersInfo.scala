In the biomedical field in particular, errors in judgment on these aspects can have real consequences for patient care, whether indirectly via portals used by researchers (e.g. International Cancer Genome Consortium data portal), or directly in the case of internal hospital systems (typically kept private).

         |All these experiences led me to develop my own tool, Gallia, with the aim of streamlining the process of data transformation, and which draws on all the issues I've encountered using existing tools (as well as their strengths!). I'm also developing a tool intended to help with the modeling aspect - with an emphasis on semantics - and hope to publish it as well at some point in the future.
