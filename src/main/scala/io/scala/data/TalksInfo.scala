         |
         |Smithy is the culmination of ~14 years of iterations in the field of code-generation. It is an elegant declarative language that enables defining data types, operations and services in a clear and concise manner. The unique aspect of Smithy is that protocol concerns (transport, serialisation) are abstracted away in an extensible annotation-based mechanism. This means that Smithy can be used to describe things like rest/json services, but an infinite amount of other things.

         |Smithy4s is a Scala code-generator that feeds off Smithy files. It is unique in that it retains the protocol-agnostic nature of Smithy :the code-generator is not biased towards any protocol or serialisation mechanism. Users can generate Scala code from Smithy to get case classes and interfaces, that can be wired in runtime-interpreters in an opt-in fashion, to derive http services, or CLIs, or even pure-Scala AWS SDKs. Developers could provide support for specific protocols as third party libraries, without ever having to touch code-generation.
