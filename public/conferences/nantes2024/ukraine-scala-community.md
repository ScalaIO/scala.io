## Abstract

```
In the face of unprecedented challenges during the post-COVID and wartime period in Ukraine, the Scala community not only survived but remain strong and connected. How does one maintain connections during times when offline gatherings are not possible? Join me as I share insights gleaned from Scala events, reflecting on both successful strategies and lessons learned in the process of community building from the ground up.

Explore how Ukrainian Scala developers successfully cultivated a resilient community, from the inception of the Scala Ukraine group to the organization of supportive meetups and webinars for the Ukrainian army.

Discover our presence at conferences, active engagement in programs such as Google Summer of Code, and the establishment of a Scala book club boasting 45 meetings and ongoing. I will delve into the pivotal factors that contributed to nurturing these compact yet steadfast communities, which serve as a robust foundation for the overarching advancement of the Scala community.

#### Bio

```
Scala has been my coding playground for about 5 wonderful years. While I've never taken the stage at conferences, I'm an avid attendee, soaking up the vibrant energy of the Scala community. My journey includes sharing the love for Scala by teaching courses at the university and organising cozy Scala meet-ups with friends. I even celebrated a birthday at one of our Scala gatherings, making it a memorable affair.

Working with phenomenal individuals has shaped my perspective, making the Scala world, for me, a realm of camaraderie and shared passion. I believe friendship is the key factor in community creation, and I'm excited to delve into my experiences and insights on building strong, connected Scala communities amidst challenges.
