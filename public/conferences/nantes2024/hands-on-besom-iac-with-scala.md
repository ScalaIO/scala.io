## Abstract

In my talk I will briefly introduce Besom, a Pulumi SDK for Scala and then swiftly proceed to show - hands on - how to use it to declare cloud infrastructure and deploy your services in a simple yet safe and robust way. Besom is the first step in the new vision of programming with Scala where full products can be built using the same reliable, functional idioms. The talk will be interesting to any Scala developer who wants to upgrade her skills and capabilities in the area of cloud resource management and complete product engineering.
