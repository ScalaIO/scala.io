## Abstract

```
Learning web development through courses and books often leaves us unprepared for real-world challenges. Missing configurations, absent tests, version mismatches, and poor documentation are common hurdles that aren’t covered in simplified examples. This talk shares my journey of developing web applications with Scala, highlighting common pitfalls.

Switching from big data to web development presents its own challenges. With many stacks and frameworks available, finding one that allows a quick start and aligns with existing expertise can be difficult. I’ll discuss my experiences with the TypeLevel stack, including Doobie, Http4s, and Cats Effect for the backend, and ScalaJS and Tyrian for the frontend.

A case study on creating a library management system for the Franco-Ukrainian Toloka Association will illustrate the importance of good documentation, practical application, and learning through mistakes. Although focused on Scala, the principles and challenges discussed are relevant across various technologies. Attendees will gain a realistic perspective on the challenges of functional programming in web development and strategies to overcome them.

#### Bio

```
Scala has been my coding playground for about 5 wonderful years. While I've never taken the stage at conferences, I'm an avid attendee, soaking up the vibrant energy of the Scala community. My journey includes sharing the love for Scala by teaching courses at the university and organising cozy Scala meet-ups with friends. I even celebrated a birthday at one of our Scala gatherings, making it a memorable affair.

Working with phenomenal individuals has shaped my perspective, making the Scala world, for me, a realm of camaraderie and shared passion. I believe friendship is the key factor in community creation, and I'm excited to delve into my experiences and insights on building strong, connected Scala communities amidst challenges.
