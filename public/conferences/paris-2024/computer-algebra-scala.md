## Abstract

```
The Scala Algebra System (ScAS) is a research project devised to explore how one could use a general purpose, statically typed language such as Scala for computerized mathematics. It is at the same time a computer algebra library and a scripting interface, written with itself. As a library, it is based on a typeclass hierarchy of algebraic structures. As an interface, it comes as a Scala DSL for computer algebra, using extension methods and implicit conversions to provide a natural mathematical notation.
