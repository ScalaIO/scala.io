## Abstract

```
In this hands-on workshop, participants will dive deep into Kyo, the innovative Algebraic Effect library for Scala. We’ll start by exploring the fundamentals of algebraic effects and how they improve application development. Then, we’ll guide attendees through building a real-world application using Kyo, demonstrating its intuitive API and powerful capabilities. By the end of the session, participants will have practical experience in leveraging Kyo for building high-performance, scalable backend services. They’ll understand how to use Kyo’s pure functional approach to create more maintainable and robust code without sacrificing readability or ease of use.

Participants should have basic Scala knowledge and bring a laptop with a Scala development environment set up. We’ll provide a GitHub repository with starter code and exercises to ensure a smooth, hands-on learning experience.
