#### Bio

```
I am a Belgian programmer living in France, particularly interested in functional programming and type systems.
For nearly 15 years, I have been especially focused on the OCaml language, using it daily for personal and professional 
projects. I am also interested in web development, pin collecting, drawing, and specialty coffee.
