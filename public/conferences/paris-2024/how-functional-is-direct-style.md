## Abstract

```
Direct-style is a recent trend in Scala, with several libraries being developed to support this approach. It’s also the style embraced by OCaml’s Eio and for writing effectful Unison programs.

Is direct-style still functional? Or is it just imperative programming, as some critics argue? Can functional and imperative styles coexist?

We’ll investigate what functional programming is at its core, how it relates to effects and properties such as referential transparency, immutability, idempotence and purity.

#### Bio

```
I am one of the co-founders of SoftwareMill, where I code mainly using Scala and other interesting technologies. I am involved in open-source projects, such as sttp, MacWire, Quicklens, ElasticMQ and others. I have been a speaker at major conferences, such as JavaOne, LambdaConf, Devoxx and ScalaDays.

Apart from writing closed- and open-source software, in my free time I try to read the Internet on various (functional) programming-related subjects. Any ideas or insights usually end up with a blog (https://softwaremill.com/blog)
