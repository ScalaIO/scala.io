## Abstract

```
Functional programming is great! Immutability and an effects system make programs safer, better, stronger − but not always faster. Today, we’ll gleefully betray our functional principles, and look at how (and when!) you should consider committing such despicable acts as: - making your classes mutable and exposing their internals. - using while-loops instead of for-loops. - preferring arrays to lists or maps.

Of course, I’ll bring a few benchmarks to show the differences. And while we’re there, we’ll talk a bit about benchmarks, performance in general, and why the ‘Big O’ notation is lying to you.
```

#### Bio

```
Gaël is a Staff Engineer at Datadome, where he’s been working since 2019. He worked for 12 years doing IT consulting for big companies, before going into start-ups (and full-time Scala) in 2016. He likes refactoring stuff, teaching developers, and finding the most elegant way to implement a feature.

His Open Source projects include the TranzactIO library (for ZIO and Doobie), as well as a schedule optimizer named Gaston. In his free time, he plays strategy games and reads pretty much any science or history book he gets his hands on.
