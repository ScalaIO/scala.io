## Abstract

```
Are you using one of many type-class based libraries in Scala? Have you ever been forced to understand this “automatic vs semiautomatic” distinction? Did your builds slowed down when you started using the “derivation” thing? Did you ever hate your life when looking for a missing implicit? In this presentation you will learn the source of your issues, and a third way - sanely-automatic derivation which is fast to compile, fast to run, and easy to debug by its users.
```
