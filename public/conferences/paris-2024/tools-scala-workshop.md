## Abstract

```
This hands-on workshop will teach you the essential skills and toolkit to launch your own Scala-based product. We will talk about the stacks of libraries that work well, and we will write code for a full-stack product live. By the end of the workshop, we should have the code scaffolding for a product with essential pieces: database, HTTP, frontend, business logic and essential services, including credit card checkout. The ideal candidate for the workshop is a Scala developer comfortable with the language, with a basic dev setup (IntelliJ or Metals), and with a desire to build end-to-end Scala products or startups. Knowledge of any library stack (ZIO, Typelevel, Akka/Pekko, etc.) will accelerate the learning/practice process.
