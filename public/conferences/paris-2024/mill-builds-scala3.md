## Abstract

```
Mill is a popular build tool used in Scala projects, where build definitions are written in a dialect of Scala. As of July 2023 it only supports Scala 2 libraries and syntax. I am working until November on porting Mill to Scala 3, so that build definitions will benefit from the latest Scala 3 features. I should have made enough progress by November to talk about the various challenges.
