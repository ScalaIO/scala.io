## Abstract

```
Scala is an underrated language for full-stack applications. A Scala developer should be able to launch a startup quickly, but how?

In this talk, I will show the tools and techniques for building full-stack products in Scala, how to deploy and maintain them, and how to ship quickly and safely.

I will share

- the tools a Scala startup needs
- sets of libraries that work well in a full-stack setting
- how to build, deploy and self-host applications without - headaches or complications
- how to ship code and iterate products quickly
- how to integrate crucially important but often neglected parts, - such as payment systems
- product owner life outside Scala
```
