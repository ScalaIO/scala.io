## Abstract

```
The FastScala web framework is based on anonymous and secure callbacks from the client-side to the server-side. This allows you to build your app almost entirely in Scala, leveraging the type-safety of the language to build increasingly more complex components which allow you to implement complex interfaces quickly with a few lines of code: forms/tables/modals/etc. Iâ€™ll present the framework, its basic foundational concepts, demo what it can do, give examples of building reusable web components with this approach, discuss security, performance, scalability, and to which situations is this approach best suited.
```
