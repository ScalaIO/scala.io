# Decisions4s: Complicated Conditionals, Higher-Kinded Data and Scala 3

## Abstract

```
Higher-kinded data is a specialised application of higher-kinded types. It allows to wrap the data in a parametrised effect type (e.g. Option) and reuse the structure between different use cases. I would like to share a bit on that not-so-popular topic and when it might be a good pattern to use. I will also show new features of Scala 3 that makes this kind of type wizardy a much more pleasant experience. The talk is based on experiences with building Decisions4s, scala library for handling complicated conditional logic.
