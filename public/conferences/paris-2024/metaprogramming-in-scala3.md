## Abstract

```
I shouldn’t have to know what kind of a syntax tree a constructor call desugars into, I just want to transform between two extremely similar data types because the Internet told me I should separate my domain models into layers before I shove them between curly brackets on a socket somewhere.

Are these the kind of thoughts you entertain on a daily basis?

See, you actually CAN have the latter without the former in Scala 3 and with no loss to your compile-time comfort zone no less, so kiss your ASTs goodbye - we won’t be seeing them again.

With that in mind, you can strap in for a gauntlet style run through:
- match types
- mirrors
- typeclass derivation
- ...and the new, exciting and experimental named tuples.

All of that to build a micro-library that does customizable one-liner conversions between similarly shaped data types with some live demos, where we desperately try to make the compiler really mad at us, sprinkled in.

In short, we’ll be exploring the compile-time arsenal that Scala 3 gives us without resorting to dirty tricks.

#### Bio

```
I’ve been a Scala developer for the past 4 years now and during this time I’ve developed a liking in breaking the 4th wall of programming and the functional side of things. During my free time I usually engage in OSS, amateurishly jog, amateurishly cycle and listen to a lot of music while doing all of that. He/him.
