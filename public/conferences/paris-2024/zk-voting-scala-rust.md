## Abstract

```
Anonymous electronic voting is a fascinating subject on many aspects. A well-designed voting procedure is the cornerstone of every democracy. It must provide ballot confidentiality, coercion resistance, double vote prevention, verifiability and ideally no authority or trusted party. In this talk I’ll present Kuzh, a web application implementing distributed anonymous voting through onion routing and zero-knowledge proofs. The first implementation was done in Scala and it was later implemented again in Rust. I’ll use these two implementation to compare Scala and Rust on many levels. During the talk, the audience will be invited to ask questions anonymously ;)

I’ll start by presenting the challenges of anonymous electronic voting and the tools that cryptography gives us to reach our goal. The second part will deep into the implementations, both in Rust and Scala. Finally I’ll conclude by comparing how different it was to develop Kuzh in Scala and Rust, what was easy or difficult in both languages.
