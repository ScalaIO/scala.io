## Abstract

```
In this talk, I will introduce you to Scaladex, an exciting project I began exploring in November 2023. Scaladex represents my first foray into open source contributions, and it has fueled my passion for Scala ever since. I will provide a comprehensive demo of Scaladex, delve into the intricacies behind the application, and share my experiences working on it. Additionally, I’ll highlight my role as a Google Summer of Code 2024 mentor with Scala Center, where I am contributing to two Scaladex-related projects: “Scaladex: New Artifact Page” and “Scaladex: Displaying Information from POM Files”. This session aims to inspire you to consider Scaladex or other projects from Scala Center as your next open source endeavor. Join me to discover the potential and impact of contributing to the Scala community through Scaladex.
