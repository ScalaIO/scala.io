## Abstract

```
The presentation is about a practical example on what you will need to deal with in case you are required to work with a legacy Scala application, specifcally, using a 15 years old technology stack.

The session covers a lot of details around build tools from the past, and, strategies to overcome the issues and limitations caused because old artifactory servers were shut down.

It is expected that many people from the audience get surprised about the sbt project structure from the past, and, the complexity to use old applications.
