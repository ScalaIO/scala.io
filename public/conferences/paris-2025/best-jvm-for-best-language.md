## Abstract

```
So you have a Scala program. It works, code is clean and fairly optimized. Great! But that’s not software yet, that’s just a bunch of bytecode. You need to run it, which means you‘re choosing a JVM.

Let’s be real. You didn’t choose, did you? You took the JVM immediately available on whatever your infra is. Maybe there wasn’t any by default, so you just took “whichever OpenJDK distribution I can find first”. Probably Temurin.

In this talk, we’ll discuss other JVMs, especially performance-oriented ones: GraalVM (both Community Edition and Oracle) and Azul Prime. I’ll share a few benchmark results with you, to give you an idea of how they compare to OpenJDK. And I’ll give you the tools to investigate further should you wish to.

#### Bio

```
Gaël is a Staff Engineer at Datadome, where he’s been working since 2019. He worked for 12 years doing IT consulting for big companies, before going into start-ups (and full-time Scala) in 2016. He likes refactoring stuff, teaching developers, and finding the most elegant way to implement a feature.

His Open Source projects include the TranzactIO library (for ZIO and Doobie), as well as a schedule optimizer named Gaston. In his free time, he plays strategy games and reads pretty much any science or history book he gets his hands on.
