# Beyond `flatMap`: Is Kyo the Future of Scala Effects?

- Kind: Talk
- Slug: effets-secondaires
- Category: Effect Systems
- confirmed: true

## Abstract

```
For nearly a decade, Scala's concurrency has been driven by Akka, Cats Effect and ZIO, 
each with its own vision for purity, safety, and pragmatism. 

Kyo enters this incredible ecosystem with a fresh perspective.

This talk provides a critical, technical comparison of these three systems through a unified framework, evaluating their approaches to:

- Effect Modeling: How they represent, compose, and handle effects and errors.

- Concurrency & Resilience: The guarantees and costs of their fiber and structured concurrency models.

- Developer Experience: The trade-offs in readability, ergonomics, and type-driven safety.

We will focus on how Kyoâ€™s use of algebraic effects complements the work of its predecessors. 
You'll see how it embraces Scala 3 and understand why it earns its place in an already fantastic field.
