# Laminar: Make UIs that flow

- Kind: Talk
- Slug: laminar-make-uis-that-flow
- Category: Web
- confirmed: true

## Abstract

```
Scala.js is awesome for the web, and I will convince you to use Laminar in your next project with an interactive UI. The library is designed to make reactive state as easy as possible. Watch how to: manage state and updates, integrate with legacy UI frameworks, and interaction with backend.

I am drawn to Laminar because it is quite agnostic to “effects”, everything is built around observables - either signals or event streams. It manages the connections between all observables with a direct acyclic graph, meaning there is no inconsistency. There are still some sharp edges such as avoiding cycles (harder to notice the further away the state is from the interactive elements).

Requirements: I guess vague familiarity with current UI practices such as react. I have experience in building multiple settings pages with Laminar, involving wrapping various UI elements provided by the host platform’s UI kit. Laminar makes it pretty simple to build reusable components.
