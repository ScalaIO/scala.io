## Abstract

```
Soundness provides everything you need to build applications in Scala, whether they run on the command-line, on the web or in the cloud. Soundness was built from the ground up in Scala 3, as a collection of libraries—to be used à la carte or à volonté—for performing a diverse range of common programming tasks, from generic derivation to interactive web forms; compile-time testing to regular expressions; working with JSON to bytecode analysis; interacting with Git to representing time.

Soundness is not just a new standard library: it’s a suite of libraries for performing over a hundred distinct programming tasks, all of them designed around two core principles of “soundness”: that impossible states should be unrepresentable, and that transitions between states should be total. Soundness was developed over four years, exclusively for Scala 3, and using every wonderful new feature it provides.

This talk will give a whirlwind tour of some of the capabilities of Soundness, focusing on the lucid philosophy that has driven each of its component parts, with a nod towards Soundness’s future embrace of capture checking.
