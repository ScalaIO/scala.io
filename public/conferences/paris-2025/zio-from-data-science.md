## Abstract

```
ZIO has a reputation for being powerful — but intimidating, especially if you’re not fluent in functional programming. In this talk, I explore ZIO through the lens of a machine learning practitioner who doesn’t speak in morphisms or monads — and doesn’t need to.

Why not just stick with Python? Because deploying Python ML models is notoriously painful. Scala was built for robust systems, and ZIO leverages that power to offer a practical, testable, and type-safe approach to production ML.

We’ll walk through real-world ML workflows using ZIO:

- Expressing failure and requirements with types.
- Assembling components with `ZLayer` dependency injection.
- Parallelizing training using ZIO’s concurrency model.
- Streaming large or real-time data via `ZIO Streams`.
- Serving models efficiently with `ZIO HTTP`.

If you’ve ever struggled to scale notebooks, wrangle side effects, or make your models production-ready, ZIO might be the missing piece — and you won’t need to know what a morphism is to use it.

#### Bio

```
I am a Section Leader in Data Analytics at the National Control Center of the Electrical Grid Operator in Greece. With a background in Electrical & Computer Engineering and a PhD in Electromagnetism, I’ve spent the last 20 years developing software, specializing in data analysis, machine learning, and optimization.

I’m passionate about Scala, using it both professionally and in side projects. I’ve also contributed as a technical reviewer and editor for Manning Publications, primarily on machine learning and deep learning titles.

When I’m not working, I enjoy spending time with my family and staying active.
