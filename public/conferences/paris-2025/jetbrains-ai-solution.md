## Abstract

```
In the last few years, one of the leading new areas of development in JetBrains has been AI assistance. It started with simple access to an external large language model within IntelliJ IDEA—but we didn’t stop there.

Today, JetBrains offers a wide range of new features and extensions that can make software developers work more quickly and productively. During this talk, we will go through the most important of them - AI Assistant, Junie, local and cloud completion, connecting to local LLMs, the integration of Model Context Protocol, and more. We will discuss how these tools can boost your productivity and improve your coding experience. We will also talk about AI agents in general, and the future of AI assistance.

The talk will consist of animated infographics and live coding examples.
