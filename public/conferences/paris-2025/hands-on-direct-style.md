# Hands-on Direct Style

## Abstract

```
Direct Style programming is an exciting development for the future of Scala, but something that can seem a little abstract and remote.

The purpose of this talk is to introduce the problem Direct Style is trying to solve and then, step by step, build up to the solution that the Scala compiler team is building to. We’ll see what’s already implemented and ready for use right now, but also the things that are still needed in order for the entire vision to be realised.

By the end of the talk, we’ll have created a respectable set of effects and their handlers, and written an entire program using them to demonstrate how natural that style of programming can be.

#### Bio

```
Nicolas writes code for J.P. Morgan, where we use Scala to make some very complicated things seem very simple.

After  too many years as a Java programmer and a thankfully brief stint in  marketing, Nicolas discovered Functional
Programming through Scala and  fell in love. Since then, he's made it his mission to learn and explain  the scary bits,
by focusing on practical applications.

Nicolas is also the author and sole maintainer of a few useful OSS libraries, such as [kantan.csv](https://nrinaudo.github.io/kantan.csv/).
