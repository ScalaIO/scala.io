## Abstract

```
ScalaTest 3.3 introduces a pure, functional way to test. At its heart is Fact, a composable “Boolean with error messages” that offers an alternative to exception-based assertions. In this talk you’ll see Fact in action—standalone, in pure style traits, and powering property-based testing.
