#### Bio

```
I'm a software engineer for 15 years now, my technical evolution reflects the industry's growth - starting with Java enterprise development, transitioning to TypeScript and React, and now specializing in Scala and ZIO for functional programming. At Squircles i learn how to run Event-Sourcing and CQRS architectures in production, which I believe represent resilient systems.
