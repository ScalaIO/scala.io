## Abstract

```
Designing APIs is always a balancing act between collaboration and productivity. On one side, an API-first approach allows product and management teams to agree on contracts early, providing clarity across teams. On the other side, developers often prefer a Scala-first workflow, where they define routes in ZIO-HTTP and generate the OpenAPI spec from code. This approach also makes it easier to adapt API documentation to future changes, whenever new endpoints or parameters are added or removed in code, the API spec is updated automatically, keeping documentation in sync without extra effort.
