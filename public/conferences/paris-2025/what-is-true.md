## Abstract

```
From ancient philosophy to modern software, humanity has always asked: how do we know what's true? This talk explores what truth means in math, journalism, law, science—and in the code we write every day. As AI becomes an increasingly common collaborator in software development, verifying that our programs align with our intent has never been more important.

ScalaTest 3.3 introduces Fact, a pure, functional approach to testing. At its core, Fact is a composable “Boolean with error messages”—an alternative to exception-based assertions. In this talk, you’ll see Fact in action: standalone, in pure style traits, and powering property-based tests.

Join us on a journey that begins with the nature of reality and arrives at practical insights for building software we can trust, even in an AI-augmented world.
